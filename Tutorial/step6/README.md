## Step 6: Metadata in head

When you have multiple routes you probably want to keep metadata in the `<head>` element updated too. You can render the `head` element just like any other. In this step we set the title within our asynchronously imported components and render the head element within our `for await...of` loop.

We use the  `css` [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) to move the styling we previously had in the index.html file and move it into the index.js file. More on this in the next step.
